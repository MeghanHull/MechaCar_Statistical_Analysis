# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
<!-- Automotive statistical testing using the R programming language (Rice Bootcamp) -->
## Project Overview
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress.  Production data is to be reviewed for insights that may help the manufacturing team, specifically:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a statisitical analysis of automobile performance with R.

# Results
## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
<!-- You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 1 by completing all requirements below:
- The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe (5 pt)
- An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables (10 pt)
- An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values (10 pt)
- There is a summary that addresses all three questions (5 pt) -->
**Insert summary**
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
<!-- You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 2 by completing all requirements below:
- The Suspension_Coil.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe (5 pt)
- An RScript is written to create a total summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the PSI for all manufacturing lots (10 pt)
- An RScript is written to create a lot summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each manufacturing lot (10 pt)
- There is a summary that addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and each lot individually (5 pt) -->
Write a short summary using screenshots from your total_summary and lot_summary dataframes, and address the following question:
- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
<!-- You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 3 by completing all requirements below:
- An RScript is written for t-test that compares all manufacturing lots against mean PSI of the population (5 pt)
- An RScript is written for three t-tests that compare each manufacturing lot against mean PSI of the population (10 pt)
- There is a summary of the t-test results across all manufacturing lots and for each lot (5 pt) -->

## Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
<!-- The statistical study design has the following:
- A metric to be tested is mentioned (5 pt)
- A null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is described (5 pt)
- A statistical test is described to test the hypothesis (5 pt)
- The data for the statistical test is described (5 pt) -->
